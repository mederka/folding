* Harrington 1970
- Use optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) to monitor folding
- Denature protein, dilute, and slowly cool to 30C.
- Folding curve is same for 2, 4 and 8 mg/ml
- Faster only at 16 mg/ml
* Harrington 1970
- ORD only shows helicity, no superstructure
- At low concentration monomer collagen folds into itself
- There is a concentration threshold for triple helix formation
* Gelatin
- Forms when collagen is heated and rapidly cooled
- The collagen molecules form triple helices
- But the superstructure gets missaligned
- Why doesn't gelatin form in vivo?
* Bellamy 1971
- Incubate cells with tritiated proline
- Cells make collagen at 6 min/chain 
- Look for tritium on autoradiograph
- "Fresh" tritiated species have high MW
* Bellamy 1971
- With longer time you get lower MW species
- Isolated "fresh" collagen has two morphologies:
- Dense mat and "fringe"
- "Fresh collagen" == procollagen, where terminal prodomains are still attached
* Bellamy 1971
- Prodomains assisst collagen in folding
- Folding happens from C-terminus to N-terminus
- Procollagen is secreted into ECM
- Procollagen peptidase then cleaves termini
* Common diseases associated with collagen
- Osteogenesis imperfecta
- Marfan syndrome
- Ehler-Danlos syndrome
- Scurvy (Skorbut)
* Scurvy
- Chronic bleeding
- First described in long-distance sea trips
- Prolyl hydroxylase requires iron, oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, and ascorbic acid
- Scurvy is caused largely by lack of Vitamin C
* Ageing
- Collagen is cross-linked
- Cross-linking increases with age
- With time it's more and more difficult to break collagen down
- What causes crosslinking?
* Maillard reaction

* Maillard reaction = Glycation

{ img/lec10/glycation.png }
* Advanced glycation

{ img/lec10/glycation2.png }
* Advanced glycation end-products

{ img/lec10/ages.png }
* Maillard reaction
- AGE specific antibodies can be generated
- Antibodies can be used to detect AGEs in tissues
- AGE levels increase with age
- High AGE levels in diabetes
* Can anything be done?
