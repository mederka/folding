There isn't that much water in there

How is this possible?

* Peptide structure

Something needs to take care of the NH and CO groups before they can be folded into the protein core

* Pauling paper

I was thunderstruck by Pauling and Corey's paper. In contrast to Kendrew's and my helices, theirs was free of strain; all of the amide groups were planar and every carbonyl group formed a perfect hydrogen bond with an imino group four residues further along the chain. The structure looked dead right. How could I have missed it?

* Helical peptide 

{ img/lec3/helical.png }

* Î±-helices
- Between 5 and 50 amino acids long
- Have a small dipole moment
- Always right-handed
- Commonly on the outside of globular proteins

* Citrate synthase, 260-270

* Which amino acids are in Î±-helices?
ðŸ˜ƒ : Ala, Glu, Leu, Met
ðŸ˜– : Pro, Gly, Tyr, Ser
