Lecture 7

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein structure is determined by amino acid sequence

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein structure is determined by amino acid sequence
- Insides of proteins have almost no water

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein structure is determined by amino acid sequence
- Insides of proteins have almost no water
- Secondary structure takes care of hydrogen bonding
* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein structure is determined by amino acid sequence
- Insides of proteins have almost no water
- Secondary structure takes care of hydrogen bonding
- Two main motifs: helicex and sheet
* Quick overview of protein structure
- Helices have to be stabilized

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Helices have to be stabilized
- Coiled coil is an example of tertiary structure that stabilizes helices.

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Helices have to be stabilized
- Coiled coil is an example of tertiary structure that stabilizes helices.
- Sheets are a simpler fold

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Helices have to be stabilized
- Coiled coil is an example of tertiary structure that stabilizes helices.
- Sheets are a simpler fold
- Sheets can be 'sticky'

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein folding can happen in a single step (tropomyosin)

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein folding can happen in a single step (tropomyosin)
- Or in multiple steps (lens crystallin)

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein folding can happen in a single step (tropomyosin)
- Or in multiple steps (lens crystallin)
- Multi-step kinetics can be studied with CD (BGH)
- And with NMR (cytochrome c)

* Why is protein folding still a problem?

* Alzheimer's disease

* Alzheimer's disease
- A form of senile dementia
- Loss of memory, speach, face recognition, motor function
- Irreversible
- 19% in 75-85 age group
- 42% in 85+ group

* Molecular composition of plaques

{ img/lec7/glenner.png }
- First isolation of the amyloid-β peptide
* Amyloid precursor protein
- Glenner et al. injected amyloid-β into rabbits
- Isolated antibodies against amyloid-β
- Antibodies also bound to another protein
- This protein is on chromosome 21.

* APP

- DS leads to early onset AD
- Similar plaques in DS subjects
