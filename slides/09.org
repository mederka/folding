* Collagen in mammals
- 20 collagen-like genes
- Type I --> tendons, ligament, bone growth
- Type IV --> veins and arteries
* Collagen in mammals
- Type I is 1054 residues long
- 30% Gly, 10% Pro and Hyp
- Pro-Hyp-Gly sequence motif
* Collagen in mammals
- Almost no Tyr, Trp, Phe
- Resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin
- Some bacteria can produce collagenase that can break down collagen
* Molecular structure of collagen
- Initially studied for industrial reasons
- Fiber diffraction used to solve structure in 1955.
- Helix with 120° rotation and 2.86Å rise per residue
- (α-helix: 100° and 1.5Å)
* Molecular structure of collagen
- 3 helices form a triple helix
- All glycines point inside the triple helix
- Prolines reduce rotational freedom 
- Also reduce hydrogen bonds
* Where do you get the fresh collagen from?
- Must use rapidly growing tissue
- Embryonic chick tendon or baby rat tail
- Mince tissue, wash with high salt buffer
- Retain pellet, re-suspend in pH 3 buffer
- Retain supernatant, dialize, stain
* Hodge & Schmitt 1960
- Isolated collagen and stained with uranyl acetate
- Collagen has specific CD spectrum
- At 40°C 300 kDa trimer denatures into 100 kDa monomers
- Once unfolded by heat, cannot be folded again
* Hydroxyproline
- Exclusive to triple helices
- Can participate in hydrogen bonding
- Holds water around the triple helix
- Fibrils are held together by water interface
* Hydroxyproline
- Made with prolyle hydroxylase
- PH is an iron protein
- Iron effect can be measured with fibroblasts
