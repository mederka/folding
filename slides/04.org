* Helical peptide 

{ img/lec3/helical.png }

* Î±-helices
- Between 5 and 50 amino acids long
- Have a small dipole moment
- Always right-handed
- Commonly on the outside of globular proteins

* Citrate synthase, 260-270

* Î±-Helix is unstable in water
- It is difficult to fold an Î±-helix on its own in water
- It needs to stabilized by a tertiary structure
- Simplest way to do this: add another Î±-helix
* Helical coiled coil

{ img/lec4/coiledcoil.gif }
* Helical coiled coil
- First predicted in 1953
- Basis of some fibrous proteins
- Each helix turn is 3.5 amino acids
- The pattern side-chain interactions can repeat every 7 residues

* Heptad repeat

{ img/lec4/coiledscheme.png }
* Coiled coil properties
- d residue is usually Leu or Ile
- g and e residues are usually charged, create a salt bridge
- the heptad can be identified by searching through a sequence database
- Present in fibrinogen, DNA-binding proteins, collectins, actin binders
* Tropomyosin
- 1 helix pair can be 40 nm long
- Has not been crystallized the native form yet
- Has been studied extensively with CD spectroscopy
