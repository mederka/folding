* Intrinsic disorder
- Proteins that don't have a defined conformation
- Also proteins where most of the sequence is unstructured
- Such proteins can also be functional
- How?

* Intrinsic disorder
Old thinking: Either the structured parts of IDPs actually bind or IDPs adopt rigid conformation upon binding to a structured partner. The final complex must have a structure. 

* Intrinsic disorder
IDPs can bind to multiple partners. So maybe they can assume different structures.

* IDP features
- Random coil CD spectrum
- Sharp NMR peaks (no line broadening)
- Extra susceptible to proteases
- Sometimes you can get crystals

* IDPs are usually hydrophilic
- Rich in Arg, Gln, Glu, Lys, Pro, Ser
- Poor in Cys, Ile, Leu, Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Val
* IDPs are usually hydrophilic
- Composition leads to inability to fold
- Cannot form hydrophobic core
- Usually highly charged at neutral pH
- These were thought to be complimented by the binding partner

* IDPs are pretty common
- 33% of eukaryotic proteins but in only
- 2% of archaeal proteins
- 4% of eubacterial proteins

* Advantages?
- Larger interface area
- Binding to different targets
- Exposed side-chains for specificity
- Multistep mechanisms are fast
- Fast degradation

* IDP Functions
- Mostly DNA/RNA recognition
- Can serve as macromolecular mediators
- Can serve as connectors

* Linker histones
- Nucleosome binding proteins
- Stabilize condensed chromatin
- Regulate gene function
* Histone H1 structure

* Linker histones
- WH interacts with nucleosome
- C-terminal domain has ~100 residues, lots of Lys, Ala, Pro
- Six isoforms with different sequences but similar composition
- IDP?
* Linker histones
- CTD activates nuclease DFF40/CAD
- All six isoforms activate DFF40/CAD
* IDP region in yeast prions
- Ure2p and Sup35p have N-terminal prion domains that are not necessary for normal protein function.
- Prion domains are sufficient to form prions
- Domains are intrinsically disordered
- Within prions domain assume beta-sheet structure

- Two proteins: H1 and prothymosin-alfa
- ProtA is a linker histone chaperone, helps with H1 transport
- H1 largely positive, ProtA is negative
