Lecture 11
* What is a chaperone?
* What is a chaperone?
- Assist 'fresh' peptides in reaching folded state
- Essential for proper folding of some substrates
- Mediate binding of subunits
- Generate precurser for polymerisation
* What is a chaperone?
- Stabilize unfolded proteins
- Recognize misfolded proteins and 'take care' of them
- Dissociate aggregated proteins
- Were discovered via three different pathways
* Rubisco
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
- Most abundant protein in the world
* Rubisco 
- Two subunits form a dimer
- Four dimers form an octamer
- Fresh subunit always associated with another protein, which is not found in mature rubisco
- Large subunit binding protein (L/BP)
* T4 bacteriophage
- T4 assembly requires 2 proteins
- GroEL and GroES are expressed by e. coli
- Amino acid sequence of GroEL is homologous to L/BP

* Heat shock proteins
- Drosophila chromatin assembles into polytene chromosomes
- Chromatins has to open to start RNA transcription
- This can be seen by an optical microscope
- Heat shock some flies and see which chromosomes changed confomation

* Heat shock proteins 
- SDS-PAGE used to identify the proteins expressed during heat shock
- Heat shock proteins (Hsp) discovered: Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp100, JHsp20-26
- Hsp60 is a homologue of GroEL

* Chaperone elucidation
- Lorimer group cloned rubisco gene into e. coli
- Expressed protein has very little activity
- Overexpressed GroE in same model => rubisco activity increase
* Chaperone elucidation
- Denature active rubisco in different media
- With GdnHCl get a random coil
- No refolding when diluting into mild buffers
- Some refolding at 10Â°C, after 44h
* Chaperone elucidation
- 100% activity only happens in presence of chaperones and ATP
- 25Â°C, 30 min
- 1:1 chaperone/rubisco for optimal activity
* Is order important?
- Add chaperone after rubisco dilution
- Works if chaperone is added right away
- No activity if waiting for 30 minutes
- Partially folded intermediate is likely the substrate
* Which folding state is recognized by chaperones?
* martin1991
- Substrates: dihydrofolate reductase (DFHR) and rhodanese
- DFHR can fold by itself
- GroEL requires ATP for function
- Adding GroEL inhibits folding of DFHR
- Adding GroES, ATP, Mg restores folding
* martin1991
- Rhodanese forms aggregates by itself
- GroEL inhibits aggregation
- But doesn't restore activity
- Activity restored when GroES, Mg, ATP added
* martin1991
- Look at Trp fluorescence of DHFR and rhodanese in different states
- Random: 355 nm, native: 332 nm, with GroEL: 243
- The GroEL 'bound' state shows ANS interaction
