- Two main motifs: helix and sheet
* Quick overview of protein structure
- Helices have to be stabilized

- Helices have to be stabilized
- Coiled coil is an example of tertiary structure that stabilizes helices.
- Sheets are a simpler fold
- Sheets can be 'sticky'

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein folding can happen in a single step (tropomyosin)

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein folding can happen in a single step (tropomyosin)
- Or in multiple steps (lens crystallin)

* Quick overview of protein structure
- Protein folding can happen in a single step (tropomyosin)
- Or in multiple steps (lens crystallin)
- Multi-step kinetics can be studied with CD (BGH)
- And with NMR (cytochrome c)

* Why is protein folding still a problem?
* Alzheimer's disease
* Alzheimer's disease
- A form of senile dementia
- Loss of memory, speach, face recognition, motor function
- Irreversible
- 19% in 75-85 age group
- 42% in 85+ group

* Molecular composition of plaques

{ img/lec7/glenner.png }
- First isolation of the amyloid-β peptide

* Amyloid beta

{ img/abeta-in-context.png }

- Binds Congo red
- Binds thioflavin T
- Exhibits green-red birefringence
- Has a cross-β X-ray fiber diffraction pattern

* Amyloid precursor protein
- Glenner et al. injected amyloid-β into rabbits
- Isolated antibodies against amyloid-β
- Antibodies also bound to another protein
- This protein is on chromosome 21.

* APP

- DS leads to early onset AD
- Similar plaques in DS subjects
* Collagen
* Collagen
- Cartilage & tendons
- Skin & cornea
- Arteries and veins
- Scaffolding for teeth/bones
- Wound healing
* Collagen properties
- Fibers with 67nm intervals
- Don't compress/extend
- Secreted into the ECM
* Collagen macro-morphology
- Leather
- Glue
- Gelatin
* Collagen in mammals
- 20 collagen-like genes
- Type I --> tendons, ligament, bone growth
- Type IV --> veins and arteries
* Collagen in mammals
- Type I is 1054 residues long
- 30% Gly, 10% Pro and Hyp
- Pro-Hyp-Gly sequence motif
* Collagen in mammals
- Almost no Tyr, Trp, Phe
- Resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin
- Some bacteria can produce collagenase that can break down collagen
* Molecular structure of collagen
- Initially studied for industrial reasons
- Fiber diffraction used to solve structure in 1955.
- Helix with 120° rotation and 2.86Å rise per residue
- (α-helix: 100° and 1.5Å)
* Molecular structure of collagen
- 3 helices form a triple helix
- All glycines point inside the triple helix
- Prolines reduce rotational freedom 
- Also reduce hydrogen bonds
* Where do you get the fresh collagen from?
- Must use rapidly growing tissue
- Embryonic chick tendon or baby rat tail
- Mince tissue, wash with high salt buffer
- Retain pellet, re-suspend in pH 3 buffer
- Retain supernatant, dialize, stain
* Hodge & Schmitt 1960
- Isolated collagen and stained with uranyl acetate
- Collagen has specific CD spectrum
- At 40°C 300 kDa trimer denatures into 100 kDa monomers
- Once unfolded by heat, cannot be folded again
* Hydroxyproline
- Exclusive to triple helices
- Can participate in hydrogen bonding
- Holds water around the triple helix
- Fibrils are held together by water interface
* Hydroxyproline
- Made with prolyle hydroxylase
- PH is an iron protein
- Iron effect can be measured with fibroblasts
